# Portal Migration Report

## ✅ Completed:
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] 6 key pages migrated (with placeholders)
- [x] 5 API endpoints created (with placeholders)
- [x] Permission system framework
- [x] Upgrade page created
- [x] Templates for future migrations

## ⚠️ Partially Complete:
- [~] Customer management page (functional)
- [~] Dashboard with navigation (functional)
- [~] Permission checking (basic framework)

## ❌ Still Needed:
- [ ] 26 remaining team-portal pages
- [ ] 20+ remaining API endpoints
- [ ] Real subscription/billing integration
- [ ] Copy actual functionality from team-portal
- [ ] Test all migrated features
- [ ] Remove old team-portal routes
- [ ] Database migration for subscriptions

## 🎯 Next Priority Actions:
1. Copy actual team-portal page content to placeholders
2. Implement real API functionality
3. Connect subscription system to database
4. Test each feature individually
5. Create billing/payment integration

## 📊 Current Status:
- **Structure**: 100% complete
- **Functionality**: 15% complete  
- **Integration**: 10% complete
- **Testing**: 0% complete

## 🚨 Reality Check:
This migration created the FRAMEWORK but most functionality 
still needs to be IMPLEMENTED by copying and adapting 
the actual code from team-portal pages.
