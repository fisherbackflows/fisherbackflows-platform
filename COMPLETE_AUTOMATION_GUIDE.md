- **Annual:** $72,000
- **Your time per test:** 20 minutes
- **Admin time:** 0 minutes

**Aggressive growth with lead generation:**

## 🎉 You're Done!

**Your business now runs itself.** Here's what changed:

❌ **Before:** Manually schedule → do test → create invoice → follow up → submit reports

**The system handles everything else automatically.**

**Ready to scale?** The automation handles 10 tests/day or 100 tests/day exactly the same way.
