# Fisher Backflows - Automated Database Setup

Your Fisher Backflows application now has a fully automated customer management system with database integration. Here's how to set it up:

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. In the SQL editor, run the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` to create all tables
3. Copy your project credentials from Settings > API

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Google Calendar Integration (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMAIL=fisherbackflows@gmail.com
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **appointments** - Scheduled services with calendar sync
4. **test_reports** - Test results and compliance data
5. **invoices** - Billing with automated pricing

## üîß API Endpoints

### Automated Workflows
- `POST /api/appointments` - Books appointment + creates calendar event
- `POST /api/test-reports/complete` - Completes test + generates invoice + updates schedules
- `GET /api/customers` - Lists customers with devices and appointments
