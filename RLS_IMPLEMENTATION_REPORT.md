# Fisher Backflows Platform - RLS Implementation Report

**Report Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Database Project**: jvhbqfueutvfepsjmztx.supabase.co  
**Implementation Status**: MANUAL EXECUTION REQUIRED  

## üìã Executive Summary

The comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) implementation for Fisher Backflows Platform has been **prepared and ready for execution**. Due to Supabase API limitations for DDL operations, the implementation requires **manual execution through the Supabase SQL Editor**.

### Critical Findings

- **Current RLS Coverage**: 0% (0/25 tables secured)
- **Security Advisory Compliance**: 0% (0/4 critical tables secured)  
- **Risk Level**: **CRITICAL** - All customer data is currently accessible across tenant boundaries
- **Estimated Implementation Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Implementation Risk**: Low (service role maintains system access)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Assessment

### Current Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)

| Table | Risk Level | Current Status | Impact |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `customers` | HIGH | No RLS | Any user can access all customer records |
| `devices` | HIGH | No RLS | Device data visible across customers |
| `appointments` | HIGH | No RLS | Scheduling data fully exposed |
| `invoices` | CRITICAL | No RLS | Financial data accessible to all users |
| `billing_invoices` | CRITICAL | No RLS | Stripe billing data exposed |
| `security_logs` | CRITICAL | No RLS | System security events visible |
| `technician_locations` | HIGH | No RLS | GPS tracking data unprotected |
