## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE (MUST FIX)

### Registration System Broken
**Issue:** New customer registration returns "User not allowed" error  
**Impact:** **No new customers can register**

**Priority:** üî• **CRITICAL - BLOCKS LAUNCH**

**Evidence:**
```
Status: 500
Error: "User not allowed"
API: /api/auth/register
```

**Investigation Required:**

**Issue:** Didn't trigger rate limiting after 10 rapid requests  
**Impact:** Vulnerable to abuse/spam registrations  
**Severity:** Medium (security concern)
