# üõ°Ô∏è MANUAL SECURITY CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

**CRITICAL**: The SQL execution via dashboard appears to have run but not saved properly. Please follow these exact steps to secure the platform.

---

## üî¥ **CURRENT STATUS: SECURITY VULNERABLE**

- ‚ùå RLS policies missing on 4 critical tables
- ‚ùå Helper functions not created
- ‚ùå Anonymous access still allowed on sensitive data

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP FIX INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jvhbqfueutvfepsjmztx
2. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"New query"**

### **Step 2: Execute Helper Functions**
Copy and paste this SQL, then click **"Run"**:

```sql
-- Create helper functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_team_member()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.team_users
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.team_users
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'admin'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_customer()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.customers
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Expected Result**: "Success. No rows returned." (This is correct)

### **Step 3: Execute RLS Policies**
In a **new query**, copy and paste this SQL, then click **"Run"**:

```sql
-- Create RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "billing_invoices_team_access" ON public.billing_invoices;
CREATE POLICY "billing_invoices_team_access" ON public.billing_invoices
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (public.is_team_member());

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "security_logs_admin_access" ON public.security_logs;
CREATE POLICY "security_logs_admin_access" ON public.security_logs
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (public.is_admin());

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "technician_current_location_team_access" ON public.technician_current_location;
CREATE POLICY "technician_current_location_team_access" ON public.technician_current_location
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (public.is_team_member());

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "technician_locations_team_access" ON public.technician_locations;
CREATE POLICY "technician_locations_team_access" ON public.technician_locations
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (public.is_team_member());
```

**Expected Result**: "Success. No rows returned." (This is correct)

### **Step 4: Verify Functions Were Created**
In a **new query**, run this verification:

```sql
SELECT proname as function_name
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname IN ('is_team_member', 'is_admin', 'is_customer')
AND pronamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public');
```

**Expected Result**: Should show 3 rows with the function names.

### **Step 5: Verify Policies Were Created**
In a **new query**, run this verification:

```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('billing_invoices', 'security_logs', 'technician_current_location', 'technician_locations')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

**Expected Result**: Should show 4 rows with the policy names.

---

## üß™ **STEP 6: TEST SECURITY**

After completing the above steps, run this command to verify:

```bash
node test-rls-directly.js
```

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Service role access working
- ‚úÖ Anonymous access blocked on all 4 tables
- ‚úÖ Helper functions exist
- üü¢ RLS WORKING CORRECTLY

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If Step 4 shows no functions:
- The helper function SQL didn't execute properly
- Re-run Step 2 exactly as written
- Make sure to click "Run" after pasting the SQL

### If Step 5 shows no policies:
- The RLS policy SQL didn't execute properly
- Re-run Step 3 exactly as written
- Make sure each policy is created successfully

### If anonymous access is still allowed:
- Check that RLS is enabled on the tables:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('billing_invoices', 'security_logs', 'technician_current_location', 'technician_locations');
```
- All should show `rowsecurity: true`

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

‚úÖ **Security Fixed When**:
- 3 helper functions exist in public schema
- 4 RLS policies exist and are active
- Anonymous access blocked on all 4 tables
- `node test-rls-directly.js` shows 4/4 tables secured

---

## üìû **IF YOU NEED HELP**

If any step fails or returns unexpected results, the issue is likely:
1. SQL not being saved properly in dashboard
2. Network/session timeout during execution
3. Permissions issue with the project

**Solution**: Try executing each SQL block separately and verify each step before proceeding to the next.

**CRITICAL**: This security fix is essential before allowing customer access to the platform.
