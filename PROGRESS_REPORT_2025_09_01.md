4. **Payment Integration**: Stripe webhook ready
5. **Data Security**: RLS policies and role-based access implemented

#### Next Phase Requirements:
1. Deploy to production Vercel environment
2. Update frontend components to use working APIs
3. Complete remaining 50+ audit items systematically
4. Implement remaining business features (test reports, notifications)

### üéâ Impact Assessment

#### From Prototype to Production:
- **Before**: Mock data, non-functional APIs, no database persistence
- **After**: Full database integration, working authentication, operational business logic

#### Business Value:
- **Customer Management**: Real customer data with device tracking
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Working booking system with availability
- **Invoicing**: Complete invoice generation with line items
- **Team Access**: Secure admin portal with role-based permissions

### üìã Key Files Created/Updated:

#### Database:
- `CRITICAL_DATABASE_UPDATE_2025_09_01.sql` - Complete schema (286 lines)
- `scripts/create-test-invoices.js` - Test data generation
- `scripts/test-connection.js` - Database connectivity validation

#### APIs:
